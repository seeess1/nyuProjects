## NYU Projects

This repo includes several projects I completed during my first semester at NYU CUSP's Masters Program in Applied Urban Science & Informatics (https://cusp.nyu.edu/). I used open data and Python to analyze school performance, MTA bus routes, CitiBike rides, and more. (The map above comes from my analysis of accessibility to public tennis courts in NYC since, spoiler alert, I'm also a big tennis nerd. For any other tennis nerds out there, you can check out my write-up about the project here: https://www.authorea.com/users/249384/articles/347396-public-tennis-courts-in-nyc.) 

In the spring of 2019 I'll be diving deeper into machine learning, big data processing, and longer-term data analysis projects. Looking forward to adding to this repo.
