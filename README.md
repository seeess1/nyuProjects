## Project Overview

![Alt text](../final_project/images/tennis_sample.jpeg)

This repo contains several projects I completed during my first semester at NYU CUSP's Masters Program in Applied Urban Science & Informatics. I used open data and common Python libraries like pandas and numpy to analyze school performance, MTA bus routes, CitiBike rides, and more. (In the screenshot above you can see a map of NYC's public tennis facilities, which I was interested in as a recreational tennis player and community tennis organizer in Brooklyn.)

In the spring of 2019 I'll be diving deeper into machine learning, big data processing, and longer-term data analysis projects. Looking forward to adding to this repo.

And for any other tennis nerds out there, you can read more about my analysis of accessibility to tennis in NYC here:
