## NYU Projects

This repo includes several projects I completed during my first semester at NYU CUSP's Masters Program in Applied Urban Science & Informatics (https://cusp.nyu.edu/). I used open data and Python to analyze school performance, MTA bus routes, CitiBike rides, and more.

This spring, I'm diving deeper into machine learning, big data processing, and long-term data analysis projects. You can take a look at those projects in my [machineLearning](https://github.com/seeess1/machineLearning "machineLearning") and [bigData](https://github.com/seeess1/bigData "bigData") repos.

P.S. For anyone out there who's a tennis nerd like me, you can take a look at the tennis_accessibility notebook above or you can skip ahead to a more reader-friendly version here: https://www.authorea.com/users/249384/articles/347396-public-tennis-courts-in-nyc.
