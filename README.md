## NYU Projects

This repo includes several projects I completed during my first semester at NYU CUSP's Masters Program in Applied Urban Science & Informatics (https://cusp.nyu.edu/). I used open data and Python to analyze school performance, MTA bus routes, CitiBike rides, and more.

In the spring of 2019 I'll be diving deeper into machine learning, big data processing, and longer-term data analysis projects. Looking forward to adding to this repo.

P.S. For anyone out there who's a tennis nerd like me, you can take a look at the tennis_accessibility notebook above or you can skip ahead to a more reader-friendly version here: https://www.authorea.com/users/249384/articles/347396-public-tennis-courts-in-nyc.
